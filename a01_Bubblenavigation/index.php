            <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
                horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
                cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size
                of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't
                a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
                familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling
                salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and
                housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
                raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned
                to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops</p>
